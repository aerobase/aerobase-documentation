=== External configuration file

{project_name} packages loads all configuration from `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb` file. This file has strict file permissions and is owned by the root user. 
The reason for strict permissions and ownership is that `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb` is being executed as Ruby code by the root user during aerobase-ctl reconfigure. 
This means that users who have write access to `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb` can add configuration that will be executed as code by root.

You can include an external configuration file `overrides.rb` inside `/etc/aerobase/`.
Any configuration that is set in `/etc/aerobase/overrides.rb` will take precedence over the configuration from the included aerobase.rb file.
