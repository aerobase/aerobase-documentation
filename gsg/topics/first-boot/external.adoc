=== Configuring the external URL

In order for Aerobase to properly validate oauth requests it needs to know the URL under which it is reached by your users, e.g. 
`http://idp.aerobase.com`. Add or edit the following line in `/etc/aerobase/aerobase.rb`:

[source,ruby,subs="attributes+"]
----
external_url "http://idp.aerobase.com"
----

WARNING: Any changes you make to this file while the server is running will not take effect.
         Run `sudo aerobase-ctl reconfigure` for the change to take effect.
